          Gympal: Here’s What to Expect

        <section>
          <p>
            Today, I am happy to share what I have been working on for the past
            year, and invite you to join me on this journey.
          </p>

            Why I Built Gympal
          </h2>

          <p>
            All the big calorie-tracking apps felt like note-taking apps. They
            were just places to write down what you ate, like a digital diary,{' '}
            <strong>
              but I was more interested in the process of figuring out what to
              eat next.
            </strong>
          </p>
          {/* <p>
          It’s more natural for most people to figure out what to eat on their
            own, whether by trial and error, or reading up on "top 10 best foods
            for {'<insert goal>'}."
            <br /> Others might turn to a personal trainer for tailored advice.
            A personal trainer is great because they can customize
            recommendations to you specifically, taking into account things like
            your gym equipment, foods you dislike, and previous injuries. But
            why couldn't I tell an app these things instead?{' '}
            <strong>
              There just weren’t any apps offering that level of customization.
            </strong>
          </p> */}
          <p>
            It feels more natural to find out what to eat on my own, or through
            a personal trainer, since they can tailor recommendations to me
            specifically, taking into account things like my gym equipment,
            foods I disliked, and previous injuries, but why couldn't I tell an
            app these things instead?{' '}
            <strong>
              There just weren’t any apps offering that level of customization.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I quickly realized how frustrating it was to rely on fitness apps
            that treated everyone the same. Imagine opening TikTok without a
            personalized For You page—it would't satisfy me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another pain point was seasonal goals. Transitioning from bulking to
            cutting meant manually adjusting every entry to lower calories while
            maintaining macros. It was tedious and time-consuming.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then came the leftover calorie problem. If I had 700 kcal left
            on a Saturday, I was unsure of what to eat. If I was only used to
            making the same meals over and over, it felt like game-over for me.
            Why couldn’t an app just suggest something tailored to my needs?
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why I built Gympal—a simple, flexible app that helps you
            manage your diet, experiment, and discover what works for you.

            What Sets Gympal Apart
          </h2>
          <p>
            Unlike other calorie tracking apps, which are primarily food
            loggers, Gympal offers a dynamic diet management experience. We're
            not just about tracking what you eat; we provide a platform that
            actively assists in shaping your diet. This means giving you the
            tools to easily adjust meal plans and experiment with your diet in a
            way that aligns with your personal health goals. Whether it's weight
            management, muscle gain, or nutritional balance, Gympal is designed
            to be your partner in dietary exploration and personalization.
